# Favorite Matrix Client

This Firefox extension rewrites matrix.to links to always link to your favorite instance of Element web.

## Future Improvements

- Allow specifying a different instance per container
- Support overwriting other clients, once that's actually relevant
- Support arbitrary web instances once that's allowed (see https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.to/blob/dc4ccaef099b0cee625d4df6082daef50e92f9f5/src/open/clients/Element.js#L20-L24 for the hardcoded list)

## Does This Work in Browsers Other Than Firefox?

Probably, however I don't regularily use any of those browsers, nor am I familiar with how to distribute an extension for them.
