# Favorite Matrix Client

This Firefox extension rewrites matrix.to links to always link to your favorite instance of Element web.

## Installation

A stable release version is available here:

[![addons.mozilla.org/](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/files/2020/04/get-the-addon-fx-apr-2020.svg)](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/favorite-matrix-client/?utm_source=github.com&utm_content=install)

## Future Improvements

- Allow specifying a different instance per container
- Support overwriting other clients, once that's actually relevant
- Support arbitrary web instances once that's allowed (see https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.to/blob/e8fcc3d2b98f308c0257117d5c1a8aeda2c98318/src/open/clients/Element.js#L21-L28 for the hardcoded list)
- This extension will eventually be superseeded by native support from matrix.to: https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.to/issues/197

## Does This Work in Browsers Other Than Firefox?

Probably, however I don't regularily use any of those browsers, nor am I familiar with how to distribute an extension for them.
